            <u>Arrays</u>
            <br><br>
            In Java, arrays are easy ways to store large amounts of data in an organized way. They contain a certain number of identifiers, that each point to data. That data is accessible by telling the array to call that identifier.
            <br><br>
            You can visualize arrays like mailboxes on a road. Each house has a mailbox that is associated with that house, and each mailbox contains a certain amount of letters inside. 
            <br><br>
            In Java, Arrays can only have one type of data. This type is defined when the array is initialized. For example, an array of numbers can only hold numbers, and an array of Strings can only hold strings.

            </div>
            Arrays also have only a set amount of data. When they are declared, they hold a certain amount of data, and no more data can be added.

            To access the element at a certain point in the array, you call the index at which it rests. The indexes of an array start at 0 with the first element, and end at the length - 1 on the last element. To change the element at the index of the array, you also use the index.

            </div>
            To find the set storage limit of an array, you use the length variable inherent to the array class. Length is a public variable of type int, so you call from the object.
